This is a sound system for the Arduino Uno. The Arduino UNO does not have an SD card so multiple songs can not be added. The only way to add your own music is through an audio encoder yourself. The arduino does not have a lot of space in its memory; therefore, lower quality audio is needed. I have added the recomended specs for audicity, but you can use any other audio software.
//Audicity:
MME
Project rate (HZ):
8000
//
I did add a sound encoder, but the sound encoder was not created by me. The sound encoder was created by VEDTUBE. Links will be added. The music already added to the arduino already is "A quick one before the eternal worms devour Connecticut (HQ)" by "Have a nice life." Link will be added.
